      <h2>About Sproutlings</h2>
      <p>Our story begins, more or less, one global pandemic ago.</p>
      <p>It was a time for us to see if we could invest in ourselves. We also happened to start a family.</p>
      <p>First, we quit our jobs for the safety of our unborn, and while I took the opportunity to learn web development, Jaci pursued a certification in medical coding. Then what felt like all of a sudden, we had a baby, and it turns out things get harder to do. Ultimately I was fortunate to become a full-time dad, and Jaci found employment with pediatrician Dr. Shaw in Silverdale who had been in business long enough to treat four generations of patients. Jaci found records from when Shaw treated my sister 35 years ago. Ok, that aside, I never managed to put together a web development portfolio.</p>
      <p>Now that our little guy is no longer eating the corners of books, climbing furniture with the awareness of a donut, and is a little more aware of corners, I feel I've slowly been recovering the time to create something. Web development feels a little more out of reach with the advancement of AI. You suddenly almost don't need to know how to code. You just need to know how to ask.</p>
      <p>Consequently I've been looking for other opportunities. Eventually I came across microgreens as a startup, and knew it was something within our capabilities. Jaci has homemaker skills. She knits, crochets, bakes, cooks, we still have sourdough starter from the early days of the pandemic that she maintains. She also likes to garden. This year she's constructed her own little space of zen, a greenhouse. That being said, microgreens was opening a door I didn't know was there.</p>
